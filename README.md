MSX mgLunch for MegaFlashRomSCC+SD 

mgLunch! is a MSX ROM launcher for MegaFlashSDSCC+ with SofaRom

   In the previous mgLunch for MFRSSD ( https://github.com/ToughkidDev/mgLunch4MFRSSD ), OPFXSD was used, 
      but because of frequent requests to use Sofarom, I made a new version of mgLunch for SofaRom this time. 
   Because it is a fairly famous loader through SofaRun, I think many of you are familiar with it, 
      but like mgLunch, it has compressed the options of various functions so that you can use it comfortably.

I take this opportunity to thank louthrax for making the SofaRun, and thank you to those who continue to use mgLunch.
